    <h1>20 HTML TAGS</h1>
    <h3>&lt;address&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;address&gt; contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.</p>
    <h3>&lt;aside&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;aside&gt; represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's
        main
        content.</p>
    <h3>&lt;main&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;main&gt; represents the dominant content of the &lt;body&gt; of a document. The main content area
        consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central
        functionality of an application.</p>
    <h3>&lt;figcaption&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;figcaption&gt; represents a caption or legend for the rest of the contents its parent &lt;figure&gt;
        element, if any.</p>
    <h3>&lt;figure&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;figure&gt; represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption (&lt;figcaption&gt;), and is
        typically
        referenced as a single unit.</p>
    <h3>&lt;hr&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;hr&gt; represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a
        story,
        or a shift of topic with a section.</p>
    <h3>&lt;cite&gt;</h3>
    <p>The HTML Citation element (&lt;cite&gt;) is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must
        include
        either the title or author or the URL of that work.</p>
    <h3>&lt;code&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;code&gt; displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment
        of computer code.</p>
    <h3>&lt;wbr&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;wbr&gt; represents a word break opportunityâ€”a position within text where the browser may optionally break
        a
        line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.</p>
    <h3>&lt;canvas&gt;</h3>
    <p>Use the &lt;canvas&gt; with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw graphics and animations.</p>
    <h3>&lt;script&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;script&gt; is used to embed or reference executable code; this is typically used to embed or refer to
        JavaScript
        code.</p>
    <h3>&lt;caption&gt;</h3>
    <p>The HTML Table Caption element (&lt;caption&gt;) specifies the caption (or title) of a table, and if used is
        always the
        first child of a &lt;table&gt;.</p>
    <h3>&lt;datalist&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;datalist&gt; contains a set of &lt;option&gt; elements that represent the values available for other
        controls.</p>
    <h3>&lt;legend&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;legend&gt; represents a caption for the content of its parent &lt;fieldset&gt;.</p>
    <h3>&lt;meter&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;meter&gt; represents either a scalar value within a known range or a fractional value.</p>
    <h3>&lt;option&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;option&gt; is used to define an item contained in a &lt;select&gt;, an &lt;optgroup&gt; , or a
        &lt;datalist&gt;
        element. As such, &lt;option&gt; can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML
        document.</p>
    <h3>&lt;details&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;details&gt; creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled
        into an
        "open" state.</p>
    <h3>&lt;dialog&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;dialog&gt; represents a dialog box or other interactive component, such as an inspector or window.</p>
    <h3>&lt;menu&gt;</h3>
    <p>The &lt;menu&gt; represents a group of commands that a user can perform or activate. This includes both list
        menus,
        which might appear across the top of a screen, as well as context menus, such as those that might appear
        underneath a
        button after it has been clicked.</p>
